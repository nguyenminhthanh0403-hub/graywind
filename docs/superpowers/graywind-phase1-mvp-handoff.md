# Graywind Phase 1 MVP — Session Handoff

**Written:** 2026-08-13 · **For:** a fresh session resuming Task 1 of the Graywind Phase 1
implementation (subagent-driven-development), picked up mid-way through an unplanned
QuantConnect account/API-token detour.

## Goal

Graywind is a new algorithmic trading bot project. Phase 1 is a rule-based (RSI +
moving-average crossover) intraday US-equities MVP on LEAN Engine + Alpaca, proving a full
data → signal → risk-checked order → paper-fill → backtest pipeline end-to-end before any
ML or real capital. Being executed via `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`.

- Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-13-graywind-phase1-mvp-design.md`
- Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-13-graywind-phase1-mvp.md` (10 tasks)
- Progress ledger (recovery map): `.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-13-graywind-phase1-mvp/progress.md`
  — **this lives only inside the worktree below**, it is gitignored scratch, not in `git log`.

## How to resume (do this first)

1. `cd /Users/thanhnguyen/Projects/graywind/.worktrees/graywind-phase1-mvp` — confirm
   `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` says `graywind-phase1-mvp`, and
   `git log --oneline main..HEAD` is empty (0 commits ahead of main `fc82b30` as of this
   writing — all of Task 1's work so far is uncommitted, deliberately, see below).
2. Re-invoke `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` to continue. Its setup step will
   find the existing workspace via `scripts/sdd-workspace docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-13-graywind-phase1-mvp.md`
   — do not create a new one.
3. Read the ledger at `.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-13-graywind-phase1-mvp/progress.md` first.
   It is the authority on what's done — trust it and `git log` over this doc's prose if
   they ever disagree.
4. **Immediate next action:** confirm whether the user has found their QuantConnect API
   token (see "What's next" below) — everything in Task 1 is blocked on that one value.

## Current state (active files)

**Branch:** `graywind-phase1-mvp`, 0 commits ahead of base `fc82b30` (worktree created off
`main` at that commit).

**Files created (committed on `main`, before this branch):**
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-13-graywind-phase1-mvp-design.md` — Phase 1 design spec
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-13-graywind-phase1-mvp.md` — 10-task implementation plan
- `.gitignore` (root, on main) — originally just `.worktrees/`

**Uncommitted working-tree changes (Task 1, Steps 1-4 of 9 — deliberately not yet
committed, since the plan's Step 9 bundles them with the LEAN scaffold files from Steps
5-8 in one commit):**
- `.gitignore` — modified, appended `data/`, `alpaca_data/`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`,
  `.venv/`, `venv/`, `.env`, `backtests/` to the pre-existing `.worktrees/` line
- `requirements.txt` — new, untracked (`lean`, `alpaca-py`, `pytest`)
- `.venv/` — created locally (gitignored, never tracked); `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  succeeded cleanly: `alpaca-py-0.44.0`, `lean-1.0.228`, `pytest-9.1.1` on Python 3.14.6 —
  no version-compatibility issues despite Python being newer than the plan's 3.11+ floor

**Files later work will create (blocked, not started):**
- `graywind_strategy/` (LEAN project — main.py, config.json, risk/ subpackage) — blocked on
  `lean init` / `lean project-create`, see below
- `lean.json`, `data/` — same blocker

**Scratch workspace / traps:**
- ⚠️ `.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-13-graywind-phase1-mvp/` is gitignored SDD scratch (ledger +
  `task-1-brief.md` + `task-1-report.md`). It will never show up in `git log` — that's
  correct, not a bug.
- ⚠️ **`lean init` requires a QuantConnect.com account + API token** to do anything, even
  fully local Docker-only backtesting. This is a real gap in the spec's "$0 stack / free
  locally" framing that neither the spec nor the plan anticipated — QuantConnect's local
  CLI usage is free of charge, but it is NOT anonymous; it authenticates against their
  cloud API before writing anything locally. Confirmed by reading the installed `lean`
  package's own source (`init.py`, `get_credentials()` → `validate_credentials()` → a real
  network call to `api_client.is_authenticated()`) — no offline/anonymous mode exists.
  Whoever resumes should treat "create a free QuantConnect account" as a de facto
  prerequisite alongside the already-documented Alpaca paper account (Task 9).
- ⚠️ **QuantConnect account state as of this handoff:** user signed up mid-session. Org
  "Minh Thành Nguyễn" (free tier, org id `fc101acdea2b7db9704baad94f8bc8ec`).
  **User Id = `1786597952`** (found via the profile URL `/u/1786597952` — this is a public
  profile ID, not a secret, safe to reuse directly). The **API token is NOT displayed
  anywhere in the QuantConnect web UI**:
  - "Request Token Information" (Settings → Security) errors with "you must belong to a
    paid organization" — a dead end for a free-tier account.
  - "Reset My Token" (same section) first failed with "cannot reset your token while you
    have resources actively being used" — caused by a stray auto-created onboarding
    project ("Energetic Fluorescent Orange Manatee") with a running research/code
    environment. Fixed by stopping it from the ▶/■ toggle on
    `https://www.quantconnect.com/terminal/projects` under "Code Environments", then
    "Reset My Token" completed with no visible error — but the token value itself never
    appeared on-page. It most likely emails the new token to the signup address instead
    (standard practice for high-value secrets), but **this was never confirmed** — see
    "What has failed" below.
- ⚠️ Docker Desktop was NOT installed at session start. User installed it mid-session.
  Confirmed running via `/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/docker info`
  (controller check) and plain `docker --version` (implementer's Step 3, inside the venv
  context) — both succeeded, so PATH is very likely fine, but do a fast `docker info` sanity
  check before re-dispatching regardless.

**Not mine — leave alone:** nothing pre-existing besides the docs/ files listed above; this
is a brand-new repo with no unrelated history.

## What has changed

- Spec written, self-reviewed, and committed on `main` (`d7f69d8`, fixed up in `f96d8e8`
  after catching that the first draft omitted the live paper-trading data path and an
  implicit "24/7" assumption that only applies to crypto, not the equities we chose).
- Plan written (10 tasks), self-reviewed and committed on `main` (`8d8c764`) — caught and
  fixed a real bug during self-review where the position sizer computed a stop price but
  the algorithm never actually placed a stop/take-profit exit order on it.
- Worktree `graywind-phase1-mvp` created off `main` at `fc82b30` (with user's explicit
  consent, asked directly since this was a plain repo checkout, not already a worktree).
- SDD workspace + ledger created at `.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-13-graywind-phase1-mvp/`.
- Task 1 dispatched to an implementer subagent (**agent id `ae4d147e22aaed407`**, `sonnet`
  model — resume this same agent via SendMessage, don't re-dispatch fresh, its context of
  what it already tried is valuable). It completed brief Steps 1-4 (requirements.txt,
  .gitignore, Python/Docker version checks, venv + pip install) with real verified command
  output in `task-1-report.md`, then correctly stopped and reported **BLOCKED** at Step 5
  rather than guessing past the QuantConnect auth requirement.
- Controller independently verified the implementer's blocker claim (per this project's
  standing discipline of not trusting a report at face value) by having it cite exact
  source lines, and separately used the browser (claude-in-chrome, reconnected mid-session
  after an initial "not connected" state) to navigate the user's new QuantConnect account,
  locate the User Id, and work through the stuck-resource error blocking a token reset.

## What has failed / risks / caveats

- **Nothing has technically failed** — Task 1 Steps 1-4 are solid, verified work. The
  "blocker" is a genuine, now-well-understood plan/spec gap, not implementer error.
- **UNVERIFIED, and the most important open item:** whether the QuantConnect API token
  actually arrived by email after the "Reset My Token" click. This was never confirmed —
  the session moved to writing this handoff before the user checked their inbox. Do not
  assume it succeeded. If no email arrives, the next session will need to investigate
  further (possibly retrying the reset, or checking if QuantConnect's UI has a token
  display this session's navigation missed).
- **Decision carried forward, overriding nothing in the plan but worth restating:** the
  plan's Task 1 brief describes `lean init` as if it just scaffolds a config file with no
  auth step — it does not. Whoever resumes Task 1 should treat "run `lean login -u
  1786597952 -t <token>` before continuing Step 5" as an implicit addition to the brief,
  not a deviation requiring a new round of human sign-off (the human already signed up for
  the account specifically to satisfy this).

## What's next (ordered)

1. Confirm whether the user found the QuantConnect API token in their signup email. If
   not found after checking, go back to `https://www.quantconnect.com/settings/` (Security
   section) and try "Reset My Token" again — check
   `https://www.quantconnect.com/terminal/projects` → "Code Environments" for another stuck
   running environment first if it errors the same way.
2. Once both **User Id `1786597952`** and the API token are in hand, resume implementer
   agent `ae4d147e22aaed407` (SendMessage, not a fresh dispatch) with those two values,
   directing it to run `.venv/bin/lean login -u 1786597952 -t <token>`, then continue
   Steps 5-9 of `task-1-brief.md` exactly as written (`lean init`, `lean project-create`,
   package `__init__.py` files, verification, then the Step 9 commit bundling
   `requirements.txt` + `.gitignore` + everything Steps 5-8 create).
3. When Task 1 reports back (DONE / DONE_WITH_CONCERNS / BLOCKED again), follow
   `subagent-driven-development`'s normal flow exactly: generate the review package via
   `scripts/review-package`, dispatch the task reviewer, handle any fix loop. Do not skip
   review because this task had an unusual detour — the detour is resolved once the
   credentials work, nothing about the review bar changes.
4. Append the real outcome to the ledger and mark Task 1's todo complete, then proceed to
   Task 2 (PDT day-trade throttle) per the plan — it has no dependency on the QuantConnect
   account and could theoretically be done first if Task 1 stays blocked much longer, but
   the plan's task order should otherwise be followed as written.
5. Consider adding a short addendum to the spec's Scope Decisions documenting the
   QuantConnect-account prerequisite this session discovered, so a reader of the spec alone
   (without this handoff) isn't caught by the same surprise.

## Verification idioms used in this project (for the resuming session)

- Docker daemon check: `/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/docker info`
  (works even if `docker` isn't on a fresh shell's PATH) or plain `docker info`/`docker
  --version` if confirmed on PATH — both have worked this session.
- The ledger (`.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-13-graywind-phase1-mvp/progress.md`) is the
  recovery map — read it before trusting any summary, including this one.
- `task-1-report.md` in that same directory has full real command output for everything
  Steps 1-4 verified, plus the exact `lean init` failure transcript and source-line
  citations for the blocker — read it before re-explaining the blocker to anyone.
- This project's standing discipline (inherited from the Bullion project this workflow
  comes from): verify claims independently before acting on them — don't trust an
  implementer's or a web page's state at face value when a cheap real check is available
  (e.g. actually reading `lean`'s source rather than trusting the brief's assumption;
  actually checking `docker info` rather than trusting "Docker is installed").
