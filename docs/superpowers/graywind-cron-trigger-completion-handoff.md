# Graywind External Cron Trigger — Completion + DeepSeek Follow-up — Session Handoff

**Written:** 2026-09-04 · **For:** whoever resumes Graywind next — this session closed out
every actionable item from the prior handoff (secret set, Worker verified live, both
pending diffs committed and pushed, `index.html` visually verified in a real browser),
scheduled a cloud check-in for the one item that needed real elapsed time, and the owner
asked a DeepSeek-billing question that surfaced `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` as a live open thread
again — explicitly deferred ("I'll pick that up later"), not started.

## Goal

Finish the work `docs/superpowers/graywind-external-cron-trigger-handoff.md` (2026-09-03)
left open, then track the one item that couldn't be finished yet because it needs a week
of real market days to elapse.

Authorities:
- Prior handoff this resumes from (**read this too** — it has the full cadence-collapse
  diagnosis and Worker-deploy story this session doesn't repeat):
  `docs/superpowers/graywind-external-cron-trigger-handoff.md`
- Plan (external cron trigger): `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-03-graywind-external-cron-trigger.md`
  — steps 1-9 now done, step 10 (removing the workflow's own now-possibly-redundant
  `schedule:` trigger) is gated on the scheduled check-in below.
- Plan (symbol-reference table, executed prior session): `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-03-graywind-symbol-reference-table.md`

## How to resume (do this first)

1. **Confirm base:** `git log --oneline -3` on `main` should show (newest first) `fc37d46`
   (news-debate handoff doc update), `855486e` (symbol-reference fixes + cron-trigger +
   staggered schedule), `0ac52ce` (routine dashboard-data push). `git status` should be
   clean except the untracked files listed below — **local `main` and `origin/main` are
   even**, not ahead or behind.
2. Run `git status` — expect exactly the state in "Current state" below.
3. Read this handoff in full, then the prior one it supersedes for the deeper cadence-collapse
   story.
4. **Immediate next action:** nothing is currently blocking. The one open thread
   (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`) is deliberately deferred by the owner — see "What's next" — and a
   scheduled cloud check-in will report back on 2026-09-11 about the cron-cadence recovery.
   If you're reading this before that date and nothing new has come up, there's genuinely
   nothing to do here yet.

## Current state (active files)

**Branch:** `main`, even with `origin/main` (0 ahead, 0 behind).

**Committed this session:**
- `855486e` — `index.html` (symbol-reference table code-review fixes), `.github/workflows/live-trading.yml`
  (staggered/widened cron), `.gitignore` (added `node_modules/`), `cron-trigger/` (the
  Cloudflare Worker source, new). This was the prior handoff's step 3, done this session.
- `fc37d46` — `docs/superpowers/graywind-news-debate-shadow-mode-handoff.md`, updated to its
  2026-08-28 verification-pass version. This was a stray uncommitted diff that had been
  sitting in the working tree across 4+ prior sessions (prior handoff's step 5); read as a
  full diff before committing — it was a coherent, complete rewrite (verification story +
  a corrected secrets-diagnosis writeup), not corruption or garbage, so committing it as-is
  was the right resolution.

**Untracked (pre-existing, NOT touched this session, left alone — matches prior handoff's
own scope, which never included these in its commit list):**
- `docs/superpowers/graywind-external-cron-trigger-handoff.md` — the prior handoff itself.
  Tracked-status check: untracked. Per the handoff-writing convention, normally an older
  untracked handoff gets archived once 2 newer ones exist — **left in place instead**,
  because it's the one this handoff explicitly links back to for the cadence-collapse
  diagnosis and Worker-deploy story, and only 2 total exist right now (this one + that one).
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-03-graywind-external-cron-trigger.md`,
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-03-graywind-symbol-reference-table.md` — both fully
  executed plan docs, never committed by the prior session, not this session's job to fix.
- `docs/superpowers/archive/*` (6 files) — pre-existing archived handoffs, not mine.
- `scripts/fetch_serv_bars.py` — pre-existing untracked, not touched.
- `.DS_Store`, `.claude/` — not mine.

**Not mine — leave alone:** everything in the untracked list above.

## What has changed

- **Worker verified end-to-end and live.** `GITHUB_PAT` was set by the owner directly in
  their own terminal (`cd cron-trigger && npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_PAT` — never typed
  into this session, per the hard rule in the prior handoff). Confirmed working:
  `curl https://graywind-cron-trigger.nguyenminhthanh0403-hub.workers.dev` → `dispatched`
  (HTTP 200), and a fresh `workflow_dispatch` run (`33835102175`) landed in GitHub's Actions
  history (`status: in_progress`) within seconds of the curl. Plan step 8 is done.
- **Both mitigations are now live in production**, not just in the working tree — commit
  `855486e` is on `origin/main`, so the staggered/widened `live-trading.yml` schedule and
  the deployed Worker are both actually in effect now (previously the prior handoff flagged
  that neither was live yet since nothing was committed).
- **The stray news-debate handoff diff is resolved** (`fc37d46`, see above).
- **`index.html`'s symbol-reference table changes are now visually verified in a real
  browser** (this was explicitly flagged UNVERIFIED in the prior handoff — only Node-`eval`
  syntax-checked before). Method: served the repo over `python3 -m http.server 8731` (not
  `file://`, since the page fetches relative data — see `headless-chrome-verification`
  skill's gotcha #8), drove real headless Chrome via the skill's CDP probe template, and
  checked:
  - 13/13 rows render (`document.querySelectorAll('.ref-table tbody tr').length === 13`)
  - Tier column (4th `<td>`) renders as a plain unstyled integer, not misusing `.num` —
    confirmed via `outerHTML` on every row
  - Status badges correct and not misleading: AAPL/SERV/SPY show green "Live", the other 10
    show gray "Candidate" — matches the source data's `status` field exactly
  - `.ref-cell`/`.ref-cell watch` CSS classes applied; computed style shows
    `white-space: normal` (wraps instead of overflowing) with the intended muted color
  - `TIER_TARGET_WEIGHTS` constant works — SPY's row reads "70% of every account's capital..."
  - **Zero console errors, zero uncaught exceptions**
  - Screenshot taken and visually inspected (saved to `/tmp/graywind-symbol-reference-scrolled.png`,
    not committed anywhere — scratch output only, gone if `/tmp` is cleared)
- **Scheduled a one-time cloud check-in** (routine `trig_01Xs5JQhKgzfwV6cuXPpG6mF`, fires
  once at **2026-09-11T21:00:00Z**) to do the prior handoff's step 4: pull a week of
  `workflow_runs` from GitHub's Actions API, group by day/event-type restricted to
  13:30-20:00 UTC weekday market hours, compare against the ~11/day pre-collapse baseline
  and the 1-3/day collapsed period, spot-check the Worker is still returning `dispatched`
  (not a regressed 401), and **report a recommendation only** — it is explicitly instructed
  not to edit `live-trading.yml`, not to remove the `schedule:` trigger, and not to commit
  or push anything. That decision (plan step 10) stays a human-reviewed follow-up.
  Routine link: `https://claude.ai/code/routines/trig_01Xs5JQhKgzfwV6cuXPpG6mF`.
- Full test suite re-run fresh this session (not trusted from a stale count):
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q` → **481 passed**. (Unaffected by this session's
  changes — nothing Python was touched, only `index.html`, workflow YAML, and Worker JS.)
- Answered an owner question about DeepSeek API billing (no code/config changed): a $10
  top-up covers roughly 18-20 months of this feature's real usage even under a pessimistic
  worst-case estimate (both `WATCHLIST` symbols debated, both accounts, every cycle, no
  cache credit) — see "What's next" below, this surfaced the still-deferred
  `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` thread again.

## What has failed / risks / caveats

- **Nothing has failed.** Test suite green, Worker confirmed dispatching, both commits
  pushed clean fast-forwards.
- **UNVERIFIED, genuinely can't be verified yet:** whether the cron-cadence fix actually
  restored the original ~11 runs/day. Only minutes have elapsed since `855486e` went live —
  there's no week of real data yet. This is exactly what the 2026-09-11 scheduled routine
  will check. Do not attempt to answer this from less than a few days of data; if asked
  before 2026-09-11, say so rather than guessing from a partial day.
- **The screenshot evidence from the `index.html` verification lives only in `/tmp`**, not
  committed or attached anywhere durable. If someone asks "prove it visually" after this
  session ends, the screenshot may already be gone — the DOM/CSS/console assertions above
  are the durable record, not the PNG.
- **`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is still not set as a repo secret** — `news_debate_log.csv` has never
  been populated in production, unchanged from every prior handoff on this topic. This
  session did NOT set it, did NOT touch any code, and did NOT re-raise it unprompted — the
  owner asked directly ("how do i subscribe to a deepseek api key" / "how much can $10
  last me"), got informational answers only, then said "I'll pick that up later." Treat
  this exactly as before: **do not act on it or re-raise it unprompted** in a future
  session either, until the owner brings it up again.

## What's next (ordered)

1. **Nothing urgent.** The Worker is live and verified; both pending diffs are committed
   and pushed; `index.html` is browser-verified. There is no action item blocking anything
   right now.
2. **On or after 2026-09-11:** the scheduled routine (`trig_01Xs5JQhKgzfwV6cuXPpG6mF`) will
   have reported a day-by-day cadence table and a recommendation on plan step 10 (whether
   to remove `live-trading.yml`'s own redundant `schedule:` trigger). Check
   `RemoteTrigger` → `list_runs` for that trigger id, read the run's final report, and act
   on the recommendation as a human-reviewed decision — don't apply it blindly.
3. **Whenever the owner brings it up again (not before):** `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`. The path is
   known and was walked through this session: sign up at platform.deepseek.com → API Keys →
   Create new key → top up billing (prepaid credit, not subscription) → the owner sets
   `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` themselves as a GitHub Actions repo secret (same "never type a secret
   into Claude Code" rule as `GITHUB_PAT`). Cost is a non-issue at this feature's current
   2-symbol `WATCHLIST` scale — see "What has changed" above for the math. Once set, the
   next verification step is the prior news-debate handoff's own "what's next": confirm a
   real row lands in `dashboard-data/news_debate_log.csv` after the next live cycle.
4. If ever asked to re-verify `index.html` visually again (e.g. after a further edit),
   reuse the same method: `python3 -m http.server <port>` from the repo root (not
   `file://`), then the `headless-chrome-verification` skill's CDP probe template — don't
   re-derive the approach from scratch.

## Verification idioms used in this project (for the resuming session)

- Test suite: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q` — **481 passed** as of this handoff.
  Re-run rather than trusting this count once any Python file changes.
- Live workflow-run history (no `gh` CLI available in this environment; repo is public, no
  auth needed):
  `curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/nguyenminhthanh0403-hub/graywind/actions/workflows/334898521/runs?per_page=N"`
- Worker liveness/auth check:
  `curl -s -w "\nHTTP_STATUS:%{http_code}\n" https://graywind-cron-trigger.nguyenminhthanh0403-hub.workers.dev`
  — expect `dispatched` / 200; a 401 means `GITHUB_PAT` regressed.
- Visual/DOM verification of a static dashboard page that fetches relative data: serve it
  over `python3 -m http.server <port>` from the repo root, then drive real headless Chrome
  via `~/.claude/skills/headless-chrome-verification/templates/cdp_probe.mjs` (copy it out,
  edit the section below the `EDIT BELOW THIS LINE` marker) — never `file://`, and always
  cross-check the real DOM column order (`grep -n "<th>"`) before writing selectors, rather
  than assuming column position from memory.
- Live state (dashboard data): always `git show origin/main:dashboard-data/trade_log.csv`
  (and `equity_curve.csv`), never the local checkout.
- Checking whether a handoff/doc file is tracked before archiving or trusting it:
  `git ls-files --error-unmatch <path>`.
- Scheduled cloud follow-ups: `RemoteTrigger` action `list_runs` with the trigger id, then
  `get_run_log` on the resulting session, to read a scheduled check-in's report without
  visiting claude.ai directly.
