# Graywind News-Debate Shadow Mode — Session Handoff

**Written:** 2026-08-28 (supersedes the 2026-08-27 handoff of the same name — same shipped
code, no new commits since then; this version corrects a wrong secrets diagnosis the
coordinating session made this morning and adds independent verification of the overnight
build). **For:** a fresh session checking in on sub-project 3 of 3 of the capital-scaling
redesign, or debugging why `dashboard-data/news_debate_log.csv` is empty in production.

## Goal

Add a Claude-based bull/bear/judge news debate that logs a shadow-mode verdict for every
symbol/cycle next to VADER's existing sentiment score — without ever gating a trade. VADER
stays the live gate, unchanged. This is **built, tested, reviewed, merged, and pushed to
`origin/main`**, and independently re-verified (not just taken on the implementer's word) by a
second session the morning after. It still cannot run for real in production — see "What has
failed / risks / caveats" — because `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` has not been created as a repo secret.
The code is correct and waiting; only a manual secret-creation step remains.

- Spec (unchanged, still the binding authority): `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-25-graywind-news-debate-shadow-mode-design.md`
- Plan (fully executed, all 4 tasks + 1 fix wave complete): `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-27-graywind-news-debate-shadow-mode.md`
- Progress ledger for this plan's execution: deleted after the final review went clean (per
  `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`'s own convention). Reconstruct from commit
  messages + this handoff if needed.

## How to resume (do this first)

1. Confirm state: `git log --oneline -8` on `main` should show (newest first) `1f82cba`
   (this handoff, prior version), `2723bed` (plan doc), `d9c3e64` (final-review fix wave),
   `eab518a` (live_loop.py wiring), `45155a3` (evaluate_shadow_debate), `95fa50d`
   (log_news_debate), `59d5c89` (bull/bear/judge primitives), then `527e983` (pre-existing tip
   this work forked from). `main` should equal `origin/main` — confirmed via `git fetch origin
   main` this morning, no drift.
2. Run the test suite: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q` — expect `384 passed`. **Note:**
   `anthropic` must be installed into `.venv` first (`.venv/bin/pip install anthropic`) — it's
   in `requirements.txt` but wasn't in the shared `.venv` until this morning's verification
   session installed it; a fresh clone's `.venv` won't have it either until `pip install -r
   requirements.txt` runs.
3. **Immediate next action — the ONLY thing still blocking real production data:** add the
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` GitHub Actions repo secret (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions →
   New repository secret). Confirmed still missing this morning by reading an actual screenshot
   of the repo's secrets list — see "What has failed / risks / caveats" for exactly how this was
   checked (and how a *different* secret was wrongly suspected first).

## Current state (active files)

No files changed since the 2026-08-27 handoff — this update is verification + a corrected
diagnosis, not new code. See that version's "Current state" section for the full file-by-file
breakdown (`graywind_strategy/gates/news_debate.py`, `dashboard_export.py::log_news_debate`,
`live_loop.py` wiring, `live-trading.yml` env additions, `requirements.txt`/`.env.example`).
Independently re-verified this morning:
- `git diff 527e983 1f82cba -- graywind_strategy/pipeline.py graywind_strategy/gates/sentiment_gate.py graywind_strategy/backtester.py`
  → **zero lines** — the shadow-mode boundary is structurally real, not just claimed.
- `grep -n "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" .github/workflows/live-trading.yml` → present in both jobs
  (lines 53, 211) — the Critical finding from the final review really was fixed.
- Full suite run fresh (not trusting the agent's self-reported number) → `384 passed`, matching
  the report exactly.

**Not mine — leave alone:** anything under `.claude/worktrees/` (including a stale-but-merged
`graywind-yahoo-analyst-consensus` checkout, and the now-idle `agent-ac1e2a7ec9b70e6e3` worktree
— locked by the agent framework itself, left alone rather than force-unlocked); the
`project-graywind-capital-redesign.md` memory file (already updated by the coordinating session
from the 2026-08-27 handoff, reflecting sub-project 3 as SHIPPED).

## What has changed

No new commits. What changed since the 2026-08-27 handoff is verification depth and a corrected
secrets diagnosis (see below) — both happened in the coordinating session, not a code session.

## What has failed / risks / caveats

- **Nothing has failed.** 384/384 tests pass, independently re-run.
- **The feature still cannot run in production.** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is confirmed missing —
  see below for exactly how, since a wrong diagnosis happened first and is worth understanding.
- **A wrong secrets diagnosis happened this morning, corrected in-session — worth the full story
  so it isn't repeated:**
  1. The coordinating session saw `state/small`/`dashboard-data/small` don't exist on
     `origin/main` and reasoned (from a past incident on this project — unset CI secrets
     silently expand to `""` and fail silently forever) that `ALPACA_API_KEY_SMALL`/
     `ALPACA_API_SECRET_SMALL` must not be set.
  2. The user pushed back with a screenshot of the actual GitHub repo secrets list:
     `ALPACA_API_KEY_SMALL` and `ALPACA_API_SECRET_SMALL` **were both set 2026-08-26** (2 days
     before the screenshot) — the diagnosis was wrong.
  3. Root cause of the wrong diagnosis: the session checked the `live-cycle-small` job's steps
     for one run and saw the merge-into-`dashboard-data/small` step skipped, but never checked
     whether the *sibling* `live-cycle` job (the $100k account, using the long-set
     `ALPACA_API_KEY`) had the **same** step skipped on that **same** run. It had — because
     that run landed at 22:50 UTC, outside the 13:30–20:00 UTC market-hours window. Both jobs
     no-op the merge step identically when the market's closed; a missing secret and a
     closed market produce the *same visible symptom* (no new data), and only checking the
     sibling job at the same timestamp distinguishes them.
  4. Having found that, the real (still unresolved, but benign) reason `state/small` doesn't
     exist yet: the `live-cycle-small` job was added to the workflow at 2026-08-26T19:05 UTC.
     Checked every run since then (`curl .../workflows/live-trading.yml/runs?per_page=50`,
     filtered to `13:30 <= HH:MM <= 20:00` UTC) — **none** have landed inside market hours yet.
     It hasn't had a real chance to run, secret or no secret.
  5. Separately, re-checked `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` against the same screenshot: the 6 secrets shown
     are alphabetically sorted (`ALPACA_API_KEY`, `ALPACA_API_KEY_SMALL`, `ALPACA_API_SECRET`,
     `ALPACA_API_SECRET_SMALL`, `FINNHUB_API_KEY`, `FRED_API_KEY`) — where `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
     would sort (between the `ALPACA_*` rows and `FINNHUB_API_KEY`) there is nothing. This part
     of the original diagnosis was correct.
  - **Lesson for any future session on this repo:** when a data-absence symptom could be
    explained by either a missing secret OR a closed market, check the sibling/prior job's steps
    at the *same timestamp* before concluding it's the secret. The two causes are
    indistinguishable from one signal alone.
- **UNVERIFIED, not yet possible to verify:** whether the small-account pipeline actually works
  end-to-end with its now-confirmed-real secrets. No cron run has landed inside market hours
  since the job was added. This will self-resolve the next time a scheduled run falls inside
  13:30–20:00 UTC on a weekday — check `dashboard-data/small/` and `state/small/` for real
  content after that, or trigger a `workflow_dispatch` run by hand during market hours to test
  sooner.
- **DEFERRED BY DELIBERATE RULING (carried forward, unchanged) — held positions produce no
  shadow-debate row.** Debate step only runs on the `if position is None:` branch. See the
  2026-08-27 handoff for the exact fix if this needs closing later.
- **DEFERRED (carried forward, unchanged) — `debate_reasoning` is unbounded free text**
  accumulating in a file this repo also serves via GitHub Pages. No functional risk today.
- **No live smoke test of the real Anthropic API has happened** — same as the 2026-08-27
  handoff; still true, still blocked on the same secret.

## What's next (ordered)

1. Add the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` GitHub Actions repo secret (manual, human-only step) — this is
   the actual remaining blocker for sub-project 3.
2. Separately (not blocking #1): the next time a live-trading cron run lands inside 13:30–20:00
   UTC on a weekday, check whether `state/small`/`dashboard-data/small` finally get created —
   this validates the already-set `ALPACA_API_KEY_SMALL`/`ALPACA_API_SECRET_SMALL` secrets for
   the first time since they were added.
3. After `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is added and the next cron/workflow_dispatch cycle runs, check
   `dashboard-data/news_debate_log.csv` has real rows and scan the Actions run log for any
   `news debate shadow-mode error` warnings (the fail-open catch's message).
4. Let shadow-mode history accumulate; revisit deferred items (held-position coverage,
   reasoning-text size cap) only if there's a reason to prioritize them.
5. This closes out **sub-project 3 of 3** of the capital-scaling redesign — memory file
   `project-graywind-capital-redesign.md` already reflects this.

## Verification idioms used in this project (for the resuming session)

- Test suite: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q` — 384 passing. If `anthropic` isn't
  installed in `.venv`, install it first (`pip install -r requirements.txt` or just `pip install
  anthropic`) — it's a new dependency as of this sub-project.
- To distinguish "missing secret" from "no cycle has run under the right conditions yet": check
  the sibling job (or the prior day's run of the same job) at the exact same timestamp for the
  same symptom before concluding it's the secret.
- Checking real repo secrets (names only, never values) requires either `gh secret list`
  (needs `gh` CLI + auth, not available in this environment) or the user reading the GitHub UI
  directly — the unauthenticated REST API returns 401 for the secrets-list endpoint.
- GitHub Actions run/job/step history (works unauthenticated, public repo):
  ```
  curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/nguyenminhthanh0403-hub/graywind/actions/workflows/live-trading.yml/runs?per_page=50"
  curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/nguyenminhthanh0403-hub/graywind/actions/runs/<run_id>/jobs"
  ```
- Repo tree/contents without cloning: `curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/<path>"`.
- Before starting related work, check `git branch -a` / `git worktree list` / `git log --all
  --oneline` for unmerged work — this repo has a documented history of stale unmerged branches.
