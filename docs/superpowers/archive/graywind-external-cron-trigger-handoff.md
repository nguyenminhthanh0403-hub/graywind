# Graywind External Cron Trigger + Symbol Reference Table — Session Handoff

**Written:** 2026-09-04 · **For:** whoever resumes Graywind next — this session shipped two
pieces of work, neither committed yet, and left the Cloudflare Worker piece live but
non-functional pending one owner-only step.

## Goal

Two threads, both started from the prior handoff's dashboard symbol-reference-table
work and a follow-up health check of the live trading cycle:

1. **Symbol-reference table code review + fixes.** The table itself was built per its
   plan (previous session); this session ran a code review, got 8 findings, and fixed 5
   of them directly (misleading Live/Candidate status was the big one), mitigated 1 as a
   side effect, and accepted 1 as a known, deliberate tradeoff.
2. **Live trading cycle cadence collapse.** A health check found `live-trading.yml`'s
   cron firing ~11 times/day through 2026-08-25, then collapsing to 1-3 times/day from
   2026-08-26 onward — confirmed via GitHub's own Actions API, not assumption. Root cause:
   GitHub silently not creating the scheduled run (individual runs still complete in
   ~60-90s once created, ruling out a workflow-side backlog) — matches GitHub's own
   documented high-load delay/drop behavior for frequent `schedule:` triggers. Owner asked
   for a real fix, not just awareness, and picked all three mitigations discussed:
   stagger the cron minute off round numbers, widen to 30 min, and build an external
   trigger (Cloudflare Worker calling `workflow_dispatch`) that doesn't depend on GitHub's
   own flaky scheduler at all.

Authorities:
- Plan (symbol-reference table): `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-03-graywind-symbol-reference-table.md`
- Plan (external cron trigger): `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-03-graywind-external-cron-trigger.md` — steps 1-6 done, step 7 (the one owner-only step) not done, steps 8-10 blocked on it.
- Prior handoff this resumes from: `docs/superpowers/graywind-tactical-diversification-handoff.md`
- A separate, explicitly out-of-scope issue was raised and set aside this session: DEEPSEEK_API_KEY / news-debate shadow mode is still dormant (`dashboard-data/news_debate_log.csv` has never existed on either account). The owner said "don't worry about it" — do not re-raise unprompted.

## How to resume (do this first)

1. **Confirm base:** `git log origin/main..main` should be empty — this session made
   **zero commits**; everything below is uncommitted working-tree state. `git status`
   should show local `main` 2 commits *behind* `origin/main` (routine live-cron data
   pushes, harmless, resolves on next pull) — not ahead.
2. Run `git status` — expect exactly the state in "Current state" below.
3. Read this handoff in full; the two plan docs above are the ledgers for each thread.
4. **Immediate next action:** get `GITHUB_PAT` set on the Cloudflare Worker — it is
   **already deployed and firing every 15 minutes in production right now, and every
   single invocation is failing** because this one step was never completed. See the
   first trap below before doing anything else.

## Current state (active files)

**Branch:** `main`, 0 commits ahead of `origin/main`, 2 behind (harmless, routine).

**Files changed this session (uncommitted):**
- `index.html` — symbol-reference table's code-review fixes: Live/Candidate status
  badges, `main()`'s new call wrapped in try/catch, inline styles replaced with
  `.ref-table`/`.ref-cell`/`.watch` CSS classes, Tier column no longer misusing the
  `.num` (numeric) class, hardcoded "70%" replaced with a named `TIER_TARGET_WEIGHTS`
  constant. 66 insertions total (diff stat, not counting the fix-only follow-up edits).
- `.github/workflows/live-trading.yml` — cron changed from `*/15 13-20 * * 1-5` to
  `7,37 13-20 * * 1-5` (staggered off round numbers, widened to 30 min) — mitigations #1
  and #2 for the cadence collapse. Top-of-file comment rewritten to document the
  empirical diagnosis (dates, evidence, reasoning) so a future session doesn't have to
  re-derive it.
- `.gitignore` — added `node_modules/` this session (was missing entirely; without it,
  `cron-trigger/node_modules/` would get committed on a naive `git add cron-trigger/`).
- `docs/superpowers/graywind-news-debate-shadow-mode-handoff.md` — **pre-existing stray
  diff, NOT touched this session**, unresolved across 4+ sessions now (see
  tactical-diversification-handoff's own note on this).

**New untracked this session:**
- `cron-trigger/` — Cloudflare Worker source: `wrangler.toml`, `src/index.js`,
  `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `node_modules/` (now gitignored). **Already
  deployed to Cloudflare** (script name `graywind-cron-trigger`, account
  "Nguyenminhthanh0403@gmail.com's Account", id
  `366c34b19f7ba3d31be5a6617c01ff2b`) — but via direct Cloudflare API calls through the
  `plugin:cloudflare:cloudflare` MCP connection, **not** `wrangler deploy` (the owner's
  local `wrangler login` succeeded but `deploy` was never actually run — confirmed via
  `~/Library/Preferences/.wrangler/logs/*.log`, which recorded a `login` command but no
  `deploy`). Live URL: `https://graywind-cron-trigger.nguyenminhthanh0403-hub.workers.dev`.
  Cron Trigger attached and **active**: `*/15 13-20 * * 1-5`.
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-03-graywind-symbol-reference-table.md` — executed.
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-03-graywind-external-cron-trigger.md` — steps 1-6 done, step 7 not done.
- `docs/superpowers/archive/graywind-dual-account-advisor-plans-handoff.md`,
  `graywind-dual-account-tier-symbols-handoff.md`,
  `graywind-news-debate-provider-cost-handoff.md`,
  `graywind-performance-reports-handoff.md`,
  `graywind-quant-discipline-brainstorm-handoff.md` — pre-existing untracked, not
  touched this session, not mine.
- `scripts/fetch_serv_bars.py` — pre-existing untracked, not touched this session.

**Scratch workspace / traps:**
- ⚠️ **The Cloudflare Worker is live and firing every 15 minutes right now, and every
  invocation is failing.** `GET https://graywind-cron-trigger.nguyenminhthanh0403-hub.workers.dev`
  returns `failed: 401 ...` because `GITHUB_PAT` was never set — confirmed via
  `GET /accounts/.../workers/scripts/graywind-cron-trigger/secrets` → `[]` as of this
  handoff. Harmless (GitHub just rejects the unauthenticated call, no side effects), but
  the entire point of building this — decoupling from GitHub's flaky schedule — isn't
  actually helping yet.
- ⚠️ **Never type a real Cloudflare API token, GitHub PAT, or any other secret value into
  a Claude Code session — even via the `!` prefix.** Established as a hard rule this
  session: any command run through Claude Code lands in the conversation transcript. The
  `GITHUB_PAT` secret must be set by the owner directly, in their own terminal, outside
  Claude Code:
  ```bash
  cd cron-trigger && npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_PAT
  ```
  (fine-grained PAT, repo `graywind` only, `Actions: Read and write` — this is the only
  permission it needs).
- ⚠️ **`live-trading.yml`'s own `schedule:` trigger is still on the OLD problematic
  cadence in production.** The staggered/widened fix only exists in the uncommitted
  working tree — GitHub only runs what's committed on `main`. As of this handoff,
  production is still firing on the pre-fix schedule (confirmed via a `curl` against
  GitHub's Actions API as recently as run #111, `2026-09-03T21:53:46Z`, still an
  unstaggered `schedule` event). **Neither mitigation is live in production yet** —
  commit-and-push is a required step, not optional cleanup.
- ⚠️ **A Claude Code auto-mode safety classifier blocked the first Worker-deploy attempt**
  via the Cloudflare MCP connection (flagged as consequential: a new public endpoint +
  an indefinitely-recurring scheduled trigger). The owner explicitly approved proceeding
  and the retry succeeded. If a future Cloudflare API call trips the same classifier,
  that's expected, not a bug — explain and ask, don't route around it.
- ⚠️ **A new Cloudflare `workers.dev` subdomain was created this session** —
  `nguyenminhthanh0403-hub` (owner's explicit choice among 3 options; the account had
  none before this). This is a one-time, account-wide, effectively permanent setting:
  every future Worker on this account will live under
  `<name>.nguyenminhthanh0403-hub.workers.dev` unless deliberately changed later.

**Not mine — leave alone:** `.DS_Store`, `.claude/`, `scripts/fetch_serv_bars.py`, the
pre-existing `docs/superpowers/archive/*` entries listed above.

## What has changed

- Symbol-reference table: 8-finding code review → 5 fixed (status badges, try/catch,
  CSS classes, `.num` misuse, named `TIER_TARGET_WEIGHTS` constant), 1 mitigated as a
  side effect (QUBT's stale "52-week range $6.18–$25.84" was dropped from the copy
  entirely rather than fixed live), 1 accepted as a known tradeoff (static data
  duplicating Python config — the original spec's deliberate "no live fetch" scope).
- Diagnosed the cron cadence collapse with hard evidence from GitHub's Actions API
  (grouped `workflow_runs` by day and event type), not assumption.
- Applied mitigations #1+#2 to `live-trading.yml` (uncommitted).
- Built and deployed mitigation #3: a Cloudflare Worker calling `workflow_dispatch` on
  its own Cron Trigger (deployed, cron-attached, not yet functional — see traps).
- Installed the official Cloudflare Claude Code plugin
  (`claude plugin marketplace add cloudflare/skills` + `claude plugin install cloudflare@cloudflare`,
  per the user directing this session to fetch and follow
  `https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/prompt.md`) and authenticated the
  Cloudflare MCP connection to the owner's account via OAuth.

## What has failed / risks / caveats

- Nothing has failed outright, but two pieces of this session's work are incomplete and
  not yet delivering their intended effect — see the traps above.
- **UNVERIFIED:** whether the Worker, once `GITHUB_PAT` is set, actually recovers the
  cadence. Nobody has watched it fire successfully even once. Step 8 of the
  external-cron-trigger plan (curl the Worker, confirm a fresh `workflow_dispatch` run
  appears in GitHub's Actions history within ~2 minutes) has not been run.
- **UNVERIFIED:** the `index.html` changes were sanity-checked by extracting and
  `eval`-ing the inline `<script>` block in Node (syntax valid, 13 rows render), but
  never actually loaded in a real browser this session. Confirm visually before treating
  it as done.

## What's next (ordered)

1. Owner runs, in their own terminal (not through Claude Code):
   `cd cron-trigger && npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_PAT`
2. Once set, run Step 8 of `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-03-graywind-external-cron-trigger.md`:
   `curl https://graywind-cron-trigger.nguyenminhthanh0403-hub.workers.dev` (expect
   `dispatched`), then check GitHub's Actions API for a fresh `workflow_dispatch` run
   landing within ~2 minutes.
3. Commit and push: `index.html`, `.github/workflows/live-trading.yml`, `.gitignore`,
   and the new `cron-trigger/` directory (now that `node_modules/` is gitignored,
   `git add cron-trigger/` is safe). Nothing from this session has been committed yet.
4. After ~1 week of real market days with the Worker confirmed firing, re-run the
   day-by-day run-count check (group `workflow_runs` by day, same method used to
   diagnose the original problem) to confirm the cadence actually recovered. Only then
   consider removing `live-trading.yml`'s own now-redundant `schedule:` trigger (Step 10
   of the external-cron-trigger plan — a separate, later decision, not automatic).
5. Whenever convenient: resolve the stray uncommitted diff in
   `docs/superpowers/graywind-news-debate-shadow-mode-handoff.md` (unresolved across 4+
   sessions now).
6. **Not this session's scope, explicitly deferred by the owner:** DEEPSEEK_API_KEY /
   news-debate shadow-mode dormancy. Do not act on this unprompted.

## Verification idioms used in this project (for the resuming session)

- Test suite: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q` — re-run rather than trusting any
  cached count.
- Live workflow-run history (no `gh` CLI available in this environment; repo is public,
  no auth needed):
  `curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/nguyenminhthanh0403-hub/graywind/actions/workflows/334898521/runs?per_page=N"`
- Cloudflare Worker/account state: via the `plugin:cloudflare:cloudflare` MCP tools
  (`execute` with `cloudflare.request(...)`), scoped to `accountId`
  `366c34b19f7ba3d31be5a6617c01ff2b`. Re-authenticate via
  `mcp__plugin_cloudflare_cloudflare__authenticate` if the connection has dropped.
- **Never type secret values into a Claude Code session** — see the trap above; this
  applies to any future credential, not just this session's two.
- Live state (dashboard data): always `git show origin/main:dashboard-data/trade_log.csv`
  (and `equity_curve.csv`), never the local checkout.
- Checking whether a handoff/doc file is tracked before archiving or trusting it:
  `git ls-files --error-unmatch <path>`.
