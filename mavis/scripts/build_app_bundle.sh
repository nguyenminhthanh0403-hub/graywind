# The problem it solves: macOS remembers a microphone grant against the
# requesting binary's code-signing identity. The avatar runs on Homebrew
# python3.14, which is ad-hoc signed with NO team identifier, at a
# version-pinned Cellar path (.../python@3.14/3.14.6/...). So the identity is
# a bare hash of that exact binary, with nothing stable to hold onto -- macOS
# re-asks, and the entry reads "Python" rather than anything meaningful.
#
# A bundle identifier does not move when Homebrew upgrades Python.
