"""The canned Johnny line catalogue.

These are the lines pre-generated in his real voice with ChatterboxTTS, for the
moments that repeat: greeting, idle, dismissal, and the filler that covers the
wait while a real answer is converted. Substantive answers do not live here --
they are generated live and converted by `voice_client`.

**Pure stdlib on purpose.** This module is imported by both interpreters: the
3.14 runtime and the 3.12 generator that needs torch. Any import beyond the
standard library breaks the generator, and the breakage looks like a missing
catalogue rather than an import error.

Written with the `johnny-persona` skill: cynical about institutions and never
about the listener, tech-noir imagery rather than bro slang, "choom" five times
across the whole set and never opening a line. The two idle lines marked below
are the owner's own wording.
