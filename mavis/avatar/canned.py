"""Resolves a moment to a pre-generated Johnny wav.

Everything here degrades rather than raises. The audio is a gitignored build
artifact produced by a 47-minute offline job, so a fresh clone has none of it
and an interrupted run has some of it -- neither may stop the avatar from
appearing. A moment with no usable audio simply passes over in silence, and
`missing` names what is absent so the caller can say so on screen.

An entry is only usable when its recorded hash still matches the catalogue's
text for that line. Audio built from an older wording says something the
catalogue no longer claims, which is worse than saying nothing.
