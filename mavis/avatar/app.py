"""The avatar's runtime: mic, speech, backend and voice around `states`.

Two threads, one rule. Panda3D owns the main thread and must keep drawing,
so the conversation -- wake word, recording, STT, /ask, voice conversion and
audio playback, all of which block -- runs on one worker thread. The worker
never touches the scene or the state machine directly; it hands callables to
the render thread through `on_render` and waits for their result. Moving a
joint off the render thread races `forceUpdate` inside the frame and fails
intermittently rather than loudly.

Run from `mavis/`:  .venv/bin/python -m avatar.app
Press W to wake him without the wake word (the trained model may not exist
yet); Escape quits.
