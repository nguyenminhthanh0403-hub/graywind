"""The Panda3D side of the avatar: window, model, idle motion, mouth.

Two different models are supported because they move their mouths in
completely different ways, and because only one of them may be committed.

* **jonny** -- the Stuxed Sketchfab model, CC BY, in the repo. A Ready Player
  Me export, so the mouth is a `mouthOpen` *morph target*.
* **keanu** -- the KonnieGFX port of CD Projekt Red's actual character. Far
  better likeness, but it is an extracted game asset and this repository is
  public, so it is gitignored and exists only on machines that build it. It
  carries no morph targets at all; Cyberpunk animates faces with *joints*,
  which is why its facial rig survived extraction. The mouth is a rotation of
  `mid_J_jaw_JNT`.

The test suite can therefore only ever run against `jonny`, which is why both
mechanisms stay supported rather than the better model simply replacing the
other. Tests pin their model explicitly; nothing should rely on the default.

Whichever mechanism is used, the mouth only moves if the character's
`PartBundle` is told to `forceUpdate()`. Neither writing a slider nor rotating
a controlled joint updates the vertices on its own -- both look like a silent
no-op without it, and both wasted a debugging session that way.
