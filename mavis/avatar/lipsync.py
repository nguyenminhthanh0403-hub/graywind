"""Amplitude-driven mouth movement.

This model carries only two blendshapes (mouthOpen, mouthSmile) and no
visemes, so true phoneme-accurate lip-sync is not available at any price.
An RMS envelope of the finished audio is what the rig can actually
express.

Working from *finished* audio is also what keeps the 8GB M2 viable: the
envelope is computed once after voice conversion completes, so nothing
neural is running while the renderer animates.
