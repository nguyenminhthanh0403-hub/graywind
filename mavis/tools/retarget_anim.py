"""Blender headless: retarget Mixamo clips onto the Keanu rig and export a GLB.

Run with Blender, not the project venv:

    /Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender --background --factory-startup \
        --python mavis/tools/retarget_anim.py -- \
        <keanu.fbx> <texture-dir> <out.glb> idle=<Breathing Idle.fbx> smoking=<Smoking.fbx> \
        dismiss=<Dismissing Gesture.fbx>

The model ships with **no animation at all** -- a game rip gives you the mesh
and the skeleton in its authoring bind pose, arms out at 45 degrees. That pose
is most of why the avatar read as a mannequin, and no amount of procedural
head-drift on top of it helps.

**How the retarget works, and why the obvious way fails.** Each bone's rotation
is transferred as a *world-space* delta from its own rest pose:

    tgt_rot = (src_rot @ src_rest^-1) @ tgt_rest

At rest that is the identity. Because the delta is expressed in world space
rather than in either skeleton's local bone frame, it survives Mixamo and
ValveBiped having entirely different bone rolls and axis conventions. The
tempting alternative -- copying local rotations -- assumes the two rigs agree
on what "bend forward" means per bone, and produces arms rotated into the
torso.

Bones are posed parents-first so a child's world matrix is computed against a
parent already in its final pose.

**Rotation only -- the clips are treated as in-place.** This file used to carry
hip travel as well, scaled by the two rigs' height ratio, but it compared pose
bones with `is`, and bpy hands out a fresh wrapper on every access, so the
translation was never keyframed on any clip that ever shipped. Making it fire
sent the pelvis 18 metres across the room: the rigs sit at different unit
scales (the Mixamo armature carries a 0.01 object scale, this one does not) and
a height ratio does not reconcile that. Every clip used here is in-place, so
the travel bought nothing; re-deriving it properly is only worth it if a clip
that actually walks is ever retargeted.

Only the 22 body bones below are driven. The 283 CDPR facial joints are left
alone deliberately: `mid_J_jaw_JNT` stays free for lipsync to control, and
Mixamo has nothing to say about a face anyway.
